6. Nest-Based Access Control: Introduced to support the improved encapsulation of nested classes.
	 	Nest-Based Access Control is a feature introduced in Java 11 that improves the access control mechanism 
		between nested classes. It allows nested classes to access private members of other nested 
		classes within the same outer class.

7. Deprecation of Nashorn JavaScript Engine: Marked for removal.

8. Epsilon Garbage Collector: A no-op garbage collector for testing. 
	The Epsilon Garbage Collector is a no-op garbage collector introduced in Java 11. 
	It handles memory allocation but does not reclaim any memory. 
	It is mainly used for performance testing and benchmarking where garbage collection overhead needs to be minimized.
	Example Usage: To enable the Epsilon Garbage Collector, you can start your Java application with 
	the following JVM option:
	java -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseEpsilonGC -Xmx2g -Xms2g -jar myapp.jar
